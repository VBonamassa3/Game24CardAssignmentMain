# Game24CardAssignment

This assignment is all about taking 4 randomly generated cards, and making a mathematical expression using the numbers for the cards. Ace is worth 1, Jack is worth 11, Queen is worth 12, King is worth 13, and cards 2-10 are worth their face value. When functional, you will be able to get hints and refresh the cards if making an expression is not possible. I have the random images working currently, but the first set is always the same, so that is a WIP. Next I fix that and try and get the expression verify to work.
